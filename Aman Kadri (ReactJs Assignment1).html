Q6. How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? 
Installation Reactjs on Windows: 
Step 1: Install Node.js installer for windows. Click on this link. Here install the LTS version (the one present on the left). Once downloaded open NodeJS without disturbing other settings, click on the Next button until it’s completely installed. 
 Step 2: Open command prompt to check whether it is completely installed or not type the command –>  node-v 
 
Node Version is v14.15.3 
If the installation went well, it would give you the version you have installed   
Step 3: Now in the terminal run the below command:  
npm install -g create-react-app    
run the command   create-react-app –
version  4.0.3 
If everything went well it will give you the installed version of react app 
Step 4: Now Create a new folder where you want to make your react app using the below command: 
Move inside the same folder using the below command: cd newfolder (your folder name) 
 
Step 5: Now inside this folder run the command –> create-react-app YOUR_APP_NAME 
 
It will take some time to install the required dependencies 
NOTE: Due to npm naming restrictions, names can no longer contain capital letters, thus type your app’s name in lowercase. 
 
Step 6: Now open the IDE of your choice for eg.  Visual studio code and open the folder where you have installed the react app newfolder (in the above example) inside the folder you will see your app’s name rapp (In our example). Use the terminal and move inside your app name folder. 
Use command cd app (your app name) 
 
Step 7: To start your app run the below command :   npm start   
 
Once you run the above command a new tab will open in your browser showing React logo as shown below:  Congratulation you have successfully installed the react-app 
 
 Q7. How to Install NPM and How to check version of NPM? 
1.	Open your command-line interface (such as Terminal Command Prompt). 
2.	Writer the given command and press Enter: npm –version. 
3.	The command will display the version number of NPM installed on your system. 
 
Q8. How to check version of React Js? 
•	Using package.json file 
•	Using command line 
•	
Using package.json file: 
The package.json contains metadata about our project. It is created by default when we create our React project. 
The package.json file contains a lot of information in the name/value pairs in JSON format. We can easily check our React version under the list of dependencies as shown in the image given below. 
 
 
Using the command line: 
We can easily check the React version by using the command mentioned below on our command line. npm view react version 
The output demonstrating the use of the above command on the command line is mentioned below

 
Q9. How to change in components of React Js? 
A9. React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.

			    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
			  
			    const increment = () => {
			      setCount(count + 1);
			    };
			  
			    const decrement = () => {
			      setCount(count - 1);
			    };  



			  return (
			    <div className="App">

			      <div>
